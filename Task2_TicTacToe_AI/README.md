# Tic Tac Toe with AI (Minimax Algorithm)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a command-line Tic Tac Toe game built using Python.  
The game allows a human player (X) to compete against an AI opponent (O).

The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm**, making it unbeatable.

## 🧠 How the AI Works

The Minimax algorithm works by:

- Simulating all possible future moves
- Assuming the opponent plays optimally
- Assigning scores to outcomes (win = 1, loss = -1, draw = 0)
- Choosing the move with the best possible score

This ensures the AI never loses.

## ▶ How to Run

1. Open terminal inside project folder
2. Run:

python tic_tac_toe.py

3. Enter positions from 0 to 8 as shown below:

0 | 1 | 2
--+---+--
3 | 4 | 5
--+---+--
6 | 7 | 8

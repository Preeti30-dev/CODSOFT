# Task 3 - Movie Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning techniques.

The system recommends movies based on similarity of genre and description using TF-IDF vectorization and Cosine Similarity.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Cosine Similarity

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Movie dataset contains title, genre, and description.
2. Genre and description are combined into a single feature.
3. TF-IDF converts text data into numerical vectors.
4. Cosine similarity calculates similarity between movies.
5. The system recommends top 5 similar movies.
